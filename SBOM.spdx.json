This Agreement may only be amended in written form, signed by you and NXP.\n\n\n18.\tSEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and, unless a modification or replacement of the invalid or unenforceable provision is further held to deprive you or NXP of a material benefit, in which case the Agreement will immediately terminate, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to the intention underlying the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n\n19.\tNO WAIVER.  The waiver by NXP of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent breach of the same or a different provision.\n\n20.\tAUDIT.

You may not assign this Agreement, or any part of this Agreement, without the prior written approval of NXP, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. NXP may assign this Agreement, or any part of this Agreement, in its sole discretion. \n\n24.\tPRIVACY.

ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive\nremedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or\n(b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs\nLimited Warranty and which is returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This\nLimited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from\naccident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be\nwarranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,\nwhichever is longer.\n\nNO OTHER WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND\nITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE\nSOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.\nTHIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH\nVARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.\n \nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no\nevent shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,\nindirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,\ndamages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business\ninformation, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability\nto use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support\nServices, even if ACME has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In\nany case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this EULA shall be\nlimited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE\nPRODUCT or U.S. $5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support\nServices Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be\ngoverned by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do\nnot allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not\napply to you.",
